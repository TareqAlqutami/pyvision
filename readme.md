## **Setup**
You need to either create a virtual environment to install the dependencies or install them directly into your current python environment. A virtual environment is recommended. You can use `virtualenv` as shown below. Other alternatives are conda and pyenv.
```Shell
virtualenv -p python3.7 venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

After getting the environment, you can install all dependencies in `requirements.txt`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
